    Hi ~_USERNAME_,<br>
    <br>
    Your RippleID password was changed on _TIME_. <br>

    If you didn't change your password, your account might have been hijacked. To get back into your account, you'll need to use the secret key you received when you created the account to log in.<br>
    <div>Thanks,</div>
