~_USERNAME_,

The password for your Ripple Trade - ~_USERNAME_ - was recently changed. 
If you made this change, you don't need to do anything more. 

If you didn't change your password, your account might have been hijacked. To get back into your account, you'll need to use the secret key you received when you created the account.

Sincerely,

The Ripple Team
